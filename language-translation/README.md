# Language Translation with Deep Learning using TensorFlow on FloydHub

## Presented at [Nashville Artificial Intelligence Society](https://www.meetup.com/Nashville-Artificial-Intelligence-Society/events/239553403/)

# Talk Overview: 
Nasar, S. is going to take you into the realm of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). He will be training a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new (unseen) sentences from English to French. 
This will be a walkthrough of an end to end technique to train a Deep RNN model. You will learn to build various components necessary to build a Sequence-to-Sequence model.

You will learn about the fundamentals of Deep Learning, mainly RNN, concepts that will be required in this solution. A familiarity of Deep Learning concepts would be handy, but most of the concepts used in this example will be covered during the demo.
