## Tracking the trajectory of the ball in a soccer video

# The Goal of the Project

> A video of a player taking a shot at a soccer ball is analyzed. The video analysis detects the trajectory of the soccer ball, and creates an image tracing the path of the soccer ball, showcasing the curvature and trajectory of the ball. This analysis would help the player and the coach analyze the quality & accuracy of the shots. Various geometric and statistical values would be extracted and presented in textual format. One of the values that was calculated was the speed of soccer ball and the angle of the trajectory of the soccer ball.
